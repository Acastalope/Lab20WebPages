		<p class= "Learning Java">I am currently a student at Grand Circus enrolled in a Java bootcamp. It is exciting, but the pace is so fast that, unfortunately, I am not able to keep up. Nonetheless, I continue putting in effort to try and learn this skill. My hope is that persistence will pay off. </p>

		<h1>Hometown</h1>
		<p>Detroit is my hometown. I've only ever left it briefly to attend college out-of-state for a couple of years. There's a lot to love and hate about Detroit, but I stay here because I mostly love it. Witnessing the city's resurgence is exciting, though unfortunately, it seems to be leaving out many of the same people who have been here during Detroit's less fortunate days.</p>
